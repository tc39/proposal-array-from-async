<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is the formal specification for a proposed Hack-style pipe operator <code>|&gt;</code> in JavaScript. It modifies the original <a href=https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/>ECMAScript specification</a> with several new or revised clauses. See <a href=https://github.com/js-choi/proposal-hack-pipes/blob/master/README.md>the proposal's explainer</a> for the proposal's background, motivation, and usage examples.</p>

<p>This document presumptively uses `&quest;` as the placeholder token for the topic reference. This choice of token is not a final decision; `&quest;` could instead be `%`, `@`, `#`, or many other tokens.</p>

<p>This section is a wholly new sub-clause of the <a href=https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-lexical-environments>original Lexical Environments clause</a>.</p>
</emu-note>

<p>The <dfn>topic binding</dfn> of a Lexical Environment immutably binds the topic reference `&quest;` to one value of any ECMAScript language type (called the <dfn>topic value</dfn> or simply the <dfn>topic</dfn>), within that Lexical Environment, at the time of the Lexical Environment's instantiation. The topic of a Lexical Environment conceptually serves as the value that the lexical context is "about".</p>

<p>A <dfn>topic-binding environment</dfn> is a Lexical Environment that establishes a topic binding. The <dfn>topic environment</dfn> of the running execution context is its Lexical Environment's nearest outer environment that is a topic-binding environment, as defined by the abstract operator GetTopicEnvironment.</p>

<emu-note>
<p>The <strong>only</strong> Lexical Environments that are topic-binding environments are declarative environments that are associated with <strong>|PipelineTopicBody|</strong> and which were created with the <strong>TopicEnvironmentInstantiation</strong> abstract operation.</p>

<p>In addition, |PipelineTopicBody| <strong>hides</strong> its own inner topic references from the static semantic rule Contains. Within the scope of <emu-grammar>PipelineTopicBody : ConditionalExpression</emu-grammar>, such topic references would <strong>not</strong> trigger early error rules during program compilation. Instead, they would be evaluated at runtime into the values of the <strong>newly instantiated</strong> topic-binding environments' topic bindings.</p>

<p>No other Lexical Environments do not establish any topic bindings; in particular, object and global environments are never topic-binding environments.</p>

<p>In addition, |ScriptBody| and |ModuleBody| are associated with early error rules that <strong>forbid</strong> their containing the topic reference `&quest;`, <strong>except</strong> where the topic reference is within |PipelineTopicBody|. These early error rules are defined using the static semantic rule Contains, from which |PipelineTopicBody| hides the topic reference.</p>

<p>This section is a wholly new sub-clause to be inserted between the <a href=https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-this-keyword>original `this` Keyword clause</a> and the <a href=https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-identifier-reference>original Identifier Reference clause</a>.</p>
<p>It presumptively uses `&quest;` as the placeholder token for the topic reference. This choice of token is not a final decision; `&quest;` could instead be `%`, `@`, `#`, or many other tokens.</p>
</emu-note>

<emu-note>
<p>The <dfn>topic reference</dfn>, which is the token `&quest;`, is a nullary operator that evaluates to the value of the current Lexical Environment's topic. The topic reference acts as if it were a special variable: implicitly bound to the topic value, yet still lexically scoped. But `&quest;` is not actually an |IdentifierName| and the topic reference is not a variable, and it cannot be bound by typical assignment; instead, it is immutably bound to a value during the instantiation of certain topic-binding environments.</p>

<p>The concept of lexical topic binding is further discussed in <emu-xref href="#sec-lexical-topics">Lexical Topics</emu-xref> and in <emu-xref href="#sec-declarative-environment-records">Declarative Environment Records</emu-xref>.</p>
</emu-note>

<emu-clause id=sec-gettopicenvironment aoid=GetTopicEnvironment>
<h1>Runtime Semantics: GetTopicEnvironment</h1>
<emu-note>
<p>GetTopicEnvironment finds the Environment Record that currently supplies the topic binding (the binding of `&quest;`). That is, it finds the running execution topic's nearest-ancestral topic-binding environment, which is the nearest-ancestral outer environment that has a topic binding status of *true*. It is <strong>never</strong> called when there is no topic environment.</p>
</emu-note>
<p>When the abstract operation GetTopicEnvironment is called, the following steps are performed:</p>
<emu-alg>
1. Let _lex_ be the running execution context's Lexical Environment.
2. Repeat,
  1. Let _envRec_ be _lex_'s Environment Record.
  2. Let _status_ be _envRec_.HasTopicBinding().
  3. If _status_ is *true*, return _envRec_.
  4. Assert: _lex_ is not a global environment.
  4. Let _outer_ be the value of _lex_'s outer environment reference.
  6. Set _lex_ to _outer_.
3. Return _lex_.
</emu-alg>

<emu-note>
<p>The loop in step&nbsp;2 will always terminate because the List of environments will always end before reaching the global environment. GetTopicEnvironment will never be called when there is no topic-binding environment in the List of environments.</p>
<p>This is due to how the two syntax nonterminals associated with the global environment or module environments (i.e., |Script| and |Module|) are syntactically forbidden to contain the topic reference `&quest;`. Any use of the topic reference within those nonterminals (as detected by the static semantic rule Contains) would trigger early error rules associated with those nonterminals. It is only within nonterminals that hide the topic reference from Contains (i.e., |PipelineTopicBody|) that the topic reference is syntactically permitted.</p>

<p>This section is a wholly new sub-clause.</p>
</emu-note>

<emu-note>
<p>These <emu-xref href="#early-error">early errors</emu-xref> are designed to prevent unintentional programmer errors:</p>

<p>A pipeline’s body must use its topic reference.
`value |&gt; foo + 1` is an early error,
because it does not contain `&quest;`.
This design is because omission of the topic reference from a pipeline body
is almost certainly an accidental error.
In order to interpose a side effect
in the middle of a pipeline expression,
without modifying the data being piped through,
a comma expression may be used instead,
such as with `value |&gt; (sideEffect(), &quest;)`.</p>

<p>In addition, a `yield` expression must be wrapped in parentheses.
`value |&gt; yield &quest; |&gt; &quest; + 1` is an early error,
which can be fixed into `value |&gt; (yield &quest;) |&gt; &quest; + 1`.
This design is because the `yield` operator has a very loose precedence,
and it is likely that omitting the parentheses
(equivalent to `value |&gt; (yield &quest; |&gt; &quest; + 1)`)
is an accidental error.</p>
